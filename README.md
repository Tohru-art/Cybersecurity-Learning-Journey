# My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journey. I created this repository to help me track and orgranize my learning plans and also help others that are following the same path as me to become familiar and have a proper idea, and have more nuance about topics that I discovered through TryHackMe, HackTheBox and other learning platform, this repo will help learners to follow a path that I've set for them to get all the information and necessary ressources at their disposition also to learn the responsabilities on becoming a SOC Analyst!

/!\ - You do not need to follow at 100% my learning path, since different people may have other ways to achieve or learn cybersecurity. This space mostly documents my own experiences that I've gained through labs, skill development, and continuous learning efforts in the field. So, please be aware that this repo is non-exhaustive.

## My Future Plans

I am amazed by the cybersecurity work field, and decided to focus on the defensive aspect of a SOC. My current focus is on developing the core competencies required for a SOC Analyst, including:

* **Mastering Security Operations:** Understanding alert triage, incident response, and security monitoring.
* **Deepening Technical Proficiency:** Gaining expertise with industry-standard tools like SIEMs (Splunk, ELK), network analysis tools (Wireshark, Zeek), and forensic utilities.
* **Understanding Attacker Methodologies:** Learning offensive techniques to better defend against them.
* **Cultivating Critical Thinking:** Sharpening my analytical and problem-solving skills through real-world scenarios.
* **Contributing to a Secure Digital World:** Applying my knowledge to protect organizations from evolving cyber threats.

## TryHackMe Progress & Achievements

TryHackMe is one of many learning platform to gain knowledge about cybersecurity in his all, which I highly recommend for those who have an interest in Blue-Team and also Red-Team. I go through their labs to gain hands-on experience in a controlled environment.
